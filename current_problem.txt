PROBLEM STATEMENT:
"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'update' of null" when calling set in an event after destroy
This manifests when using an evented object that has a listener that destroys the Component & a subsequent listener that sets a value on the Component.

HINTS:
@btakita what should the intended behaviour be? And what's up man lol.
Would a dev mode error like this solve the problem?

> You cannot call `.set(...)` on a component that has been destroyed


I'd rather it not throw an error.

Right now, I shimmed a method that checks to see if the component is "active" before calling `set`.

```
export function set__svelte(C, ...rest) {
  return C._fragment ? C.set(...rest) : C
}
export const set = set__svelte
```
What's the situation in which `set` is being called after `destroy`? Just wondering if there's a different way of getting at this, without adding a `this._destroyed` check for each `set` call (which certainly isn't the worst thing in the world, but good to avoid it if it's masking a separate problem)
It's difficult to avoid this issue using events that are ordered by definition, as previously defined events may triggers `destroy` before a later defined event triggers `set`.

Here are three areas where the logic could be handled:

* Event handler ordering - imposes difficult & otherwise unnecessary constraints on the programmer
* Guard clause in the event handler - Which is what I'm doing right now. It creates an otherwise unnecessary helper function, though it's relatively painless & could be a useful "seam" later on
* `console.warn`
* `this._destroyed` guard clause in svelte

I'm ok with `console.warn`, even though it would still encourage me to have a helper function. Letting it throw an error would require debugging for somebody unfamiliar with the problem. Maybe put a link to this ticket, or a section in the Readme to resolve?

I would slightly prefer the `this._destroyed` guard but now that there's a helper function, it's not that big of a deal.
I debounce some method calls to the next animation frame, and in those methods I've been forced to check for `this._destroyed` before continuing.
