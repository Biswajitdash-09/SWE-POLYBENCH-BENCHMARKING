PROBLEM STATEMENT:
<textarea value='{{foo}}'> doesn't work
[Repro here](https://svelte.technology/repl?version=1.20.2&gist=703b45513de90fe93bb47eafc61b3f8b) — the generated code is wrong:

```diff
if ( textarea_value_value !== ( textarea_value_value = state.foo ) ) {
-  setAttribute( textarea, 'value', textarea_value_value );
+  textarea.value = textarea_value_value;
}
```


HINTS:
`<textarea>{{foo}}</textarea>` works, doesn't it? I'm not sure why we'd want to support `<textarea value='{{foo}}>` when `<textarea value='some text'>` doesn't work in regular HTML. I might be being overly pedantic.
Because the way that you update the contents of a textarea is with `textarea.value = content` - I'd argue it's more natural (and certainly easier to implement!) than `<textarea>{{value}}</textarea>`
Just ran into this issue moments ago, and I was about to open an issue about this. I'm glad you ran into this as well!
I don't see a reason not to allow using `value`, adds parity with the other form elements and since this is a compiler it doesn't add more code to the output.
